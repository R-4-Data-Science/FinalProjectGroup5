Description: This package implements logistic regression through methods of
    numerical optimization. It contains all the basic functions that perform
    logistic regression and produces a number of outputs derived from 
    the ensuing results. You can output the intial values for optimization, 
    bootstrap confidence intervals where you can choose both the number of 
    bootstraps and the significance level, as well as a plot of the fitted 
    logistic regression curve. Further, you can produce the resulting Confusion 
    Matrix using a cut-off value of 0.5. Paired with this matrix, you can 
    produce related metrics like prevalence, accuracy, specficity, etc. Note, 
    any of the availible metrics can be plotted over a grid of cut-off values. 
    Each function has help documentation to guide their use.
